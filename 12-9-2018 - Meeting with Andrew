- map piece most difficult
	--> dependent on other components
	--> Andrew + Robert advice: don't wait on map piece
		--> focus shifts

- collaboration technique
	--> work together on components in hopes to double team mapping later on

- work over break?
	--> good idea to regroup and work, but also not necessary

- Robert's notes:
	--> can meet w/ him on campus
	--> shooting video with Katie from career services most likely during first week after break
		--> will have t-shirts for the fair and the video shoot
