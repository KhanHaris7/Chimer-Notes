- Set up Pivotal for tracking progress
	--> even if it is just researching

- Start learning things
	--> attempt to learn architecture

- Next meeting
	--> discuss SCRUM Meeting aswell as design

What to do now:
	- Set up accounts on Pivotal
	- Research on PWA architecture
		--> come together Sunday morning and create something presentable
			--> rundown of PWA architecture
			--> tools/architecture we chose and why

	- Finish bulk of use cases
