Meeting notes with Andrew:

Questions:

Scalability of the application in the future:
- Enormous career fair about 2000 people who will be matching using the app

- Planning to create new instances of the app

- Creating from the admin panel


Dev Testing team? Who to go for technical questions ?
- Dominic Deques student at CU-Boulder
- Develops some tools --> code aspect


Spec Documentation:
- Need to make edits/refinements

(My Use Case) Career Fair information:
- Students editing the fields to input their information for matching purposes

- Watch out for overlapping: Employee information and sponsors 

-Student does not need to create login or user name to match with a potential employer at the career fair.

Next Steps:
- Continue to refine all the use cases and edge cases

- What happens if the student doesn't match with any employers

Possible Technology --> ?
- Specifications
- Design  architecture of the app
- How it is going to function
- Documentation
- Coding is the last step
- Where to host the app ?

By next meeting
- List the technologies to implement each our own use cases 

- App needs to be responsive as a web application independent of device type i.e. Iphone, Samsung or Android, etc, etc.

	---> Start implementation (coding) after finalizing the spec doc by November 1st (flexible)

- Head First Design Pattern (book) for implementation of code (useful)
- Focused on easy maintaince deployment

- Increased communication with Andrew on our progress, or if we have any doubts
