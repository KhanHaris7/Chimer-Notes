==================  10-21-2018 Meeting Notes with Chimer =================

What technology/tools?
-> React for PWA architecture.

Possible Questions for Chimer: 

-> What happens if we run across a specific problem with our current based architecture, and if we find it easier using a different tool? 
-> How far back would we be on the timeline in terms of timeline?
-> How are we implementing PWA framework?

Tools/Framework for PWA architecture (My personal notes):

-> Work with most browsers and devices with a progressive codebase.
-> Fit all screen and form factors using a responsive design/
-> Leverage service workers to enable offline connectivity (HTTPS required).
-> Provide an app-like experience that leverages re-engagement tools such as push.
-> Leverage a web app manifest to describe the used resources.
-> React Framework:
 	- Benefits:
	-> Component-centered approach to development
	-> Each component is built using JavaScript, and you can easily 	
	   resuse it. 
	-> Rich data can be quickly passed through the DOM layer.
	-> DOM is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows 	
	   programs/scripts to dynamically access and update the content, 
	   structure and style of a document.
	-> XML-like syntax for writing JavaScript.

============== On Call Notes ==================

-> Firebase database: Host the Chimer mobile app. 
-> Very scalable and cost effective.
-> But is it Applicable ?
-> There's no way to save results from previous career fairs, cannot save data from more than 3 months and before.

Feedback from CU tech fair (10/3-10/4):
-> 300 students used Chimer, great!
-> 75 % of the students who took the exit survey, Chimer was somewhat useful.
-> Setting up meeting with Lisa (Career Services) in early November for updates. 
-> Finalizing the tools and technologies we are going to implement before next sprint meeting.  
-> Begin technical implementation on November 1st onwards. 
-> Contacts for code development support.
-> Possible 1:1 meetings with each of us.
   -> Possibly finalize our roles before Wednesday.


=== Update for my Use Case 5b === 
-> Create an additional case. 
-> If the user clicks on the icon, then he should be linked to the companies detailed profile.
-> Degree Requirements.
