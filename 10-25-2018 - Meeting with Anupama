- Need to understand PWA architecture and decide on one
- Use Pivotal, add Andrew and Robert so they can see progress 
- No lectures after Thanksgiving Break
	--> should focus on implementation
- Dominic: contact
	--> on Swisslog Team
- Need to be more active on Slack
	--> Andrew/Robert mentioned this to Anupama
- Mid-semester evaluation from Chimer
	--> Rating: A
		--> No plus or minus
- Demo each part
	--> meeting two weeks from now

Question(s) to Ask:
- Is the application set up to where after a student uses the app, can they give a review of the app or give feedback?
- A lot of questions for clarification on Slack
