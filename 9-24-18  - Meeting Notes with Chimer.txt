Notes on Chimer Shared Docs

-- sketch of app
	-- rematching option
		--> leads to 8 questions again
			--> are these selected from the original 10 or are they different? how are they different?
	-- summary
		--> matching algorithm
		--> rematch or continue
		--> company sponsors that match with you
			--> if you click on them, granted more info such as degree required, description, job title, etc.
		--> map

-- How the app should work
	--> matching
		--> if no matching, skip to go to map
			--> most functionalities wouldn't work, thus requiring temporary pages

-- why build a progressive web application (PWA)
	--> option to always be on the home screen of a phone
		--> exposure to the application 
	--> work no matter the network conditions
	--> increase engagement and awareness
	--> improved conversions 

	--> reliable
		--> open when no network or fairly low-speed
			--> 53% of users abandon the website if the page took longer than 3 seconds to load
	--> fast
		--> smooth page transitions
	--> responsive
	--> installable
	--> splash screen
		--> feels more like a native app
- what is spec documentation
	--> specifies the functions that a system or component must perform 

-prototype
	--> I like the matching screen with employer and then match level
		--> users are able to click on interested employer and find more info
	--> I feel the most difficult aspect is providing a map of the fair in a non-confusing and aesthetically pleasing manner
	--> I like the idea of highlighting the match level color of the employer on the map of the fair

-- main colors
	--> mainly green, then blue, then white
