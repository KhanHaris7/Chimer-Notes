- Tech Fair Exit Survey
	--> 76% very to somewhat useful
- All Campus Fair Exit Survey
	--> No one said it was useless
	--> 87% very to somewhat

- all mobile-based hopefully in the future
- 8 questions instead of 10

- map piece
	--> advantage: gets rid of map booklet to print out w/ employer info to hand out to students 
	--> advantage: match-level color coding is a cool piece to implement, sets Chimer apart from competitors

- information on not maching w/ employers?
	--> should these employers be brought back?
	--> what % of employers not matching well?

- matching w/ sponsors on sponsorship level
	--> tiers
	--> icons, emblems to distinguish between different sponsor levels
	--> "more bang for your buck w/ platinum level sponsors"
	--> providing sponsorship level affects clicks / matches

- archiving
	--> borderline of saving private data
		--> want to move away from this
	--> could instead screenshot/save/download results to phone

- notetaking
	--> accessing comments/making comments

- workshops ahead of time
	--> "I'd love to have this information ahead of time"
	--> prepare-for-fair-workshop?
