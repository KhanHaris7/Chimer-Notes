Personal Notes
- PWA architecture
	--> need to first choose a core framework
		--> ReactJS?
		--> AngularJS?
	--> Template
		--> Poylmer
			--> open source project
	--> Monitoring
		--> Lighthouse
			--> plugin for google chrome
				--> analytics on:
					--> App can load offline/flaky connections
					--> Page load performance is fast
					--> Site is progressively enhanced
					--> Network connection is secure
					--> User can be prompted to add to home screen
					--> Installed web app will launch with custom splash screen
					--> Address bar matches brand colors
					--> Design is mobile friendly

- Went over homework deadlines
- Worked on Risk log

- Questions to ask Chimer
	--> scalability? Plan for future?
	--> architecture for offline mode? 
	--> How many actual members? Who can we go to for technical questions?
